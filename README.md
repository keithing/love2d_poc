# Love 2D Proof of Concept

This repo contains a few small sketches of games developed in Love2D.  It
demonstrates very basic animation, tile integration and networking. To run
games, install Love2D and run with

```bash
love physics
```

Where `physics` is the name of the folder containing a `main.lua`.
